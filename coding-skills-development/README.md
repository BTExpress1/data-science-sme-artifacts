# Coding Skills Development

This artifact showcases algorithmic fluency and interview readiness through reusable patterns, tested scripts, and annotated notebooks. It supports preparation for technical interviews, live coding rounds, and production-grade scripting.

## Contents

- `notebooks/`: Annotated walkthroughs of problem-solving patterns (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer, backtracking)
- `scripts/`: Modular Python implementations of common algorithmic challenges
- `tests/`: Unit tests using `pytest` to validate correctness and edge cases
- `utils/`: Reusable utilities for timing, logging, and input generation

## Strategy

Each script is:
- Modular and testable
- Annotated for clarity
- Benchmarked for performance
- Designed to reinforce pattern recognition under pressure

## Reuse Scenarios

- Interview prep (LeetCode, HackerRank, system design)
- Outreach signal for hands-on fluency
- Coaching or mentoring junior engineers
