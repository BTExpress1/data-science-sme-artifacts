# Data Science SME Artifacts

This repository showcases modular, domain-specific artifacts designed to demonstrate Staff-level expertise in data science. Each folder contains a targeted deliverable that reflects best practices in modeling, experimentation, deployment, and business impact — with a strong emphasis on auditability, reproducibility, and stakeholder alignment.

## 🧠 Purpose

To support job search outreach, bid readiness, and skill benchmarking by providing reusable, feedback-driven artifacts that highlight subject-matter depth across key dimensions of modern data science.

## 📦 Structure

- `model-governance-notebook/`  
  A compliance-aware notebook outlining model risk tiers, approval gates, bias checks, and audit logging.

- `experiment-tracker-demo/`  
  A reproducible experimentation framework using MLflow or custom YAML-based tracking.

- `deployment-pipeline-mock/`  
  A mock CI/CD pipeline with drift detection, rollback logic, and monitoring hooks.

- `business-impact-case-study/`  
  A case study demonstrating KPI alignment, stakeholder storytelling, and decision impact.

## 🔍 Strategy

Each artifact is designed to:
- Address a specific skill gap or outreach signal
- Be modular and reusable across roles and bids
- Support feedback-driven iteration and benchmarking

## 🛠️ Usage

Clone the repo and explore each folder independently. Artifacts are self-contained and include README files for context and usage.
